Create executive function tests for your research with plenty customization.

TestPlatform is a platform used in scientific research in Neuroscience and Behaviour fields. project for various executive functions tests paradigms. It continuous the work initialized by [StroopTest](https://github.com/lab-neuro-comp/StroopTest), including now ReactionTest and Experiments, and soon it will include another set of cognitive tests. This is a desktop application built to be used on Windows systems.

## Key features

* Create customized Stroop Test 
* Create customized Reaction Time Test
* Create customized lists for your tests with images, words, colors and audios
* Record audios
* Record tests response from participant
* Extensive results generated, that can be exported to .csv file
* Create Experiment susing as many tests as needed of any paradigms in program
